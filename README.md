# Gengine
A library for building games with C# and Monogame (probably works with FNA also).

Features:
* Basic Entity component system
* Collision detection
* Very basic dungeon generator
* EventManager (publish/subscribe on a queue)
* State Manager (Can be used as Screens/Scenes for different parts of the game (Menu, Game, Pause etc) or inside an entity)
* ResourceManager that handles sprites, fonts
* Basic InputManager that translates input to commands on a queue
* Basic Camera
* Parallax Backgrounds
* Crude Animation system

Everything can be used standalone and does not require much of everything else.
